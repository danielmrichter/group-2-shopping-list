# React Shopping List


## Description

Duration: 1 Day Sprint

This is an app to help you keep together your shopping needs! Keeping an organized list can be annoying, especially when you need to know what you've already bought and have yet to buy.

At the top, you can add in a new item to buy. Put in the name of the item, how many you need of it, and what unit to track it by (Eg, Bread, 1, loaf.)

Then, you'll see your new item added below. If you wish to delete it, simply click the delete button and confirm in the popup that you'd like to delete it.

To mark an item as bought, click the "bought" button. It'll now appear at the end of the list, along with anything else bought.
